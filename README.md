📚 Data Structures and Algorithms - Sorting and Searching

This repository contains implementations of fundamental algorithms in Data Structures and Algorithms (DAA), including Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search.

🛠️ Algorithms Implemented

⚙️ Heap Sort

Efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm using a binary heap.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

🔎 Merge Sort

Divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

🚀 Quick Sort

Efficient sorting algorithm using a pivot to partition the array.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) in the average case.

🧮 Binary Search

Fast searching algorithm for sorted arrays using a divide-and-conquer approach.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
